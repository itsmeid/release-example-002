## Development Guidelines

### Commit Message

- Provide a clear and descriptive commit message.
- Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) format. Example formats:

  - `feat: add new feature`
  - `fix: correct bug in feature`
  - `chore: update dependencies`
  - `docs: update documentation`
  - `refactor: improve code readability`
  - [More examples](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#examples)

### Pull Request

- Provide a clear and descriptive title for your PR and use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) format for the title. Example formats:

  - `feat: add new feature`
  - `feat!: add new breaking change feature` (use `!` instead of footer token for breaking change)

- Write a concise description of the changes made and why they are necessary.
- Include any relevant issue numbers (e.g., "Closes #123").
- Ensure your code adheres to the projectâ€™s coding standards.
- Update documentation if applicable to reflect your changes.

### Git Hooks

- Use [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to implement Git hooks.
- Avoid skipping or disabling any hooks (e.g., using `-n`, `--no-verify`, etc.).

### Code Environment

- This project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for development. Make sure it is installed and set up in your workspace.
- For Windows users, it's recommended to have [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) installed.
- It's recommended to use a modern code editor (e.g., [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom-editor.cc/), etc.) to enhance your coding experience.

### Code Style

- Follow the existing coding style and conventions in this repository.
- Ensure your code passes all linting and formatting checks.

### Type Definitions

- Ensure type definitions are accurate and appropriately defined for all variables, functions, and parameters.
- Avoid using `any` whenever possible. If it is necessary, provide a clear explanation in a comment explaining why it is being used.

### Documentation

- Write doc comments for code documentations with [TSDoc](https://github.com/microsoft/tsdoc).
- After updating code documentations, run `bun out:docs` to regenerate the documentation files (no need to manually update the documentation files).

### Testing

- Write tests to verify your code works as expected.
- Ensure all existing tests pass before submitting your PR.
- Use `bun test` to run tests locally.

### Coverage

- Code coverage (runtime) should meet the project's required thresholds.
- Type coverage (compile time) should meet the project's required thresholds.
